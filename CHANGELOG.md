## [Unreleased]

(empty - ready for next release)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-19

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- Skills Install dialog now shows a persistent Close button in every installation state


## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **`vault` parent command** with five subcommands: `status`, `show`, `create`, `set`, `list`. Bare `2nb vault` prints a unified health report (docs, embedding coverage, portability, AI reachability, stale-doc count) mirroring the macOS editor's Vault Status panel.
- **`vault create`** initializes a new vault and activates it. Replaces `2nb init` (kept as a hidden deprecated alias).
- **`vault list`** shows recently-used vaults from `~/.2ndbrain-vaults`, with `*` marking the active one; stale paths are pruned on read.
- **State-aware next-step hint on bare `2nb`** — prints one of "create a note / ai setup / index / search" based on current vault state.
- **`2nb completion` command tree** — emitters for zsh / bash / fish / powershell plus a `completion install` subcommand that writes `~/.zsh/completions/_2nb` and prints the rc snippet to activate it.
- **Dynamic shell completion** on 15+ commands via Cobra `ValidArgsFunction` / `RegisterFlagCompletionFunc`: vault paths, markdown files (from the index), schema types/statuses, agent slugs, model IDs (filtered by `--provider`), AI providers, config keys, sort fields, bench probes, catalog scopes.
- **Homebrew auto-installs completions** — `brew install apresai/tap/twonb` now ships zsh/bash/fish completions via GoReleaser's `generate_completions_from_executable`.
- **Cobra `Example:` blocks** on `create`, `index`, `search`, `ask`, `list`, `read`, `ai setup`, `mcp-setup`, `skills install`, and the full `vault` subtree so `--help` shows real invocations.
- `ai.KnownProviders` and `settableConfigKeys` as canonical lists so provider names and config keys stay in sync across switch statements, error messages, and completion.
- `vault.FindVaultRoot` exported for read-only callers (e.g. completion) that need the vault root without paying a full `vault.Open`.

### Changed
- `2nb init` is a hidden deprecated alias that delegates to `vault create`; existing scripts keep working with a deprecation notice.
- Root `--help` gains a Quick Start block and an Examples section.
- `2nb` with no args uses `EmbeddingCounts()` in a single query instead of two separate `COUNT`s.
- `vault status` probes embedder and generator reachability concurrently, halving worst-case latency.
- `config get` / `config set` error message now reads from the canonical key list, so it stays accurate when keys are added.

### Fixed
- Shell completion for `config set`/`get` now suggests the keys the commands actually accept (`ai.bedrock.profile`, `ai.openrouter.api_key_env`, `ai.ollama.endpoint`, and so on) — previously the completion list had drifted from `setConfigValue`.
- Schema completers (`create --type`, `list --type`, `--status`, `meta --set`) bypass the full vault open and read `schemas.yaml` directly, so tab presses never run SQLite migrations or emit config-self-heal stderr.

## [0.1.16] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- `models add` command to add custom models to a user-maintained catalog (`~/.config/2nb/models.yaml` or per-vault `.2ndbrain/models.yaml`); entries appear in `models list` as `tier=user_verified` and in the AI setup wizard's Custom mode picker
- `models remove` command to remove models from the user catalog by model ID, provider, and scope
- User catalog layer merged into `BuildModelList`, supporting both global and per-vault scopes with conflict resolution


## [0.1.15] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Obsidian-style force-directed document graph view with canvas renderer, inspector panel, zoom/pan/drag, hover and selection highlighting, and Barnes-Hut quadtree simulation (O(n log n) at scale)
- Graph inspector panel with mode, filter, force, and color-group controls; global/local view modes
- Vault Status panel (Vault menu) — unified health view showing index state, embedding portability, stale docs, and provider reachability with Rebuild Index and Re-embed All actions
- AI Test Connection panel (AI menu) — live model probe with latency display and link to AI Setup on failure

### Changed
- Menu bar reorganized into Notes, Vault, and AI menus; File menu renamed to Notes
- Preview mode is now read-only; removed the editable preview round-trip

### Removed
- Editable preview (Turndown.js contenteditable round-trip) — corrupted markdown containing Mermaid diagrams and produced WebKit rendering artifacts


## [0.1.14] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- Commit detail view: click any commit in Git Activity to see changed files and per-file unified diffs
- `2nb git show <hash>` CLI command with `--json` support
- Outline panel click-to-scroll navigation in the editor
- Syntax highlighting for fenced code blocks in the editor
- Wikilink parsing and location resolver with heading anchor support

### Fixed
- `git.Show()` mishandled pathological filenames and git-quoted paths
- Race condition in commit detail diff loading
- Sidebar selection reliability after document operations
- Tab bar dirty-state indicator edge cases


## [0.1.13] - 2026-04-15

## [0.1.13] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- `2nb index --force-reembed` flag: invalidates all stored embeddings and re-embeds from scratch (use after switching providers)
- `2nb ai status` now reports vault portability state — dimension mismatch, model mismatch, provider unavailable, mixed embeddings, unindexed — with one-line fix hints
- `VectorCompat` helper: `search` and `ask` automatically degrade to BM25-only with a stderr warning when stored embeddings are incompatible with the current provider
- Vault `.gitignore` initialized by `2nb init` now excludes `config.yaml`, `index.db` (+ WAL), `bench.db`, `logs/`, `recovery/`, `mcp/`, and `*.bak`
- `config.yaml` self-heals: missing or corrupt config regenerates from defaults; corrupt original preserved as `.bak`
- macOS app shows a yellow warning banner over search and Ask AI results when the CLI reports degraded vector mode
- macOS app AI status dot turns yellow on any non-OK portability state

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `2nb search --json` and `2nb ask --json` now return structured envelopes — `{mode, warnings, results}` and `{mode, warnings, answer, sources}` respectively; consumers must extract `.results` / `.answer` instead of decoding a raw array/object


## [0.1.12] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Remove `nonisolated` from `WKScriptMessageHandler` conformance for Xcode 16.4 compatibility


## [0.1.11] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- SecondBrain.app distributed via Homebrew Cask (`brew install --cask apresai/tap/secondbrain`)
- GitHub Actions workflow builds, packages, and publishes the macOS app bundle on release tags
- Cask template (`casks/secondbrain.rb.tmpl`) for automated formula generation


## [0.1.10] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Search results now display RRF and cosine similarity scores (`rrf=X.XXX, cos=Y.YYY`) for transparency into hybrid ranking
- Parent-command defaults: running `2nb ai`, `2nb models`, `2nb git`, `2nb mcp`, `2nb skills`, or `2nb config` without a subcommand now invokes the most useful read-only action instead of printing help

### Changed
- Expanded MCP tool descriptions and skill file content with richer LLM-facing context for all 16 tools

### Fixed
- Wikilink resolution correctness (title/filename matching edge cases)
- Vector search threshold filtering applied consistently across hybrid and standalone semantic queries


## [0.1.9] - 2026-04-14

- New, Save, and Share toolbar buttons in editor
- Incremental re-embed on document save
- High-resolution macOS application icon set (16 px – 1024 px)

- **Tag drill-down**: click any tag in the sidebar to browse a filtered document list with back navigation
- **Index rebuild dialog**: confirmation step, dual progress bars (indexing + embeddings), and post-rebuild stats summary
- **Structured CLI logging**: slog-based log output to `.2ndbrain/logs/cli.log`; `--verbose` additionally routes to stderr
- **GUI test suite for index operations** (`tests/gui-test-index.sh`)

### Changed
- Export controller expanded with additional format and output path handling
